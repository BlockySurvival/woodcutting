# Woodcutting

This mod is an asynchrounus tree cutter for minetest. Mine the first tree node from a tree while the sneak key is pressed, then wait till the whole tree is breaked down and in your inventory.

## Highlights / Features
  - Lag-free because the work is not done at once
  - You can stop the work by press sneak key second time
  - The auto-mining speed is dependant on wielded tool, so the diamond axe is still advantageously than empty hand
  - All checks and functionalitys are processed (like hunger damage and tool wear) as if the player did the mining manually
  - Really nice effect in combination with item_drop mod
